# StoreUI

A program that keeps track of inventory for a store.

Program will display the product names, descriptions, costs, and number on hand, while allowing the user to increment or decrement the count for any particular product. In addition, each product has an associated picture.

All four fields allow the user to change the values in them, either by typing into the text fields and hitting 'Return' or by rotating the Picker.
